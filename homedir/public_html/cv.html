					   					<p>Originally from Florence, trained in London, living in Berlin, working everywhere. A digital nomad of sorts. <br><br>

										Formally educated as an interaction designer I now craft websites, create interactive installations, write and try to exercise daily with arguable results.  <br><br>

										When I'm not dealing with pixels, motors, lasers or valves <a class="link-cv" href="http://captn-crop.com/product-category/caps/6-panels/" target="_blank">I craft handmade caps</a>. I make caps to get ready for the impending baldness and to personally support and contribute to craftsmanship in a time of mass-produced mediocrity.
										Society deserves better products; better stories. <br><br>

										I believe that happiness is to be found in the process of getting to something, not the actual thing. As such I am constantly submerged in multiple creative projects around the world. Sometimes for $, some other time for fun, <a class="link-cv" href="https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/topic/precious-plastic-help-us-make-new-logo/" target="_blank">virtue or ethic integrity</a>. <br><br>
