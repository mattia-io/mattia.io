      <p class="paragraph-wok">Freelance Designer.
        <br>Over the past two years I&nbsp;have worked for various international clients on very diverse jobs. Depending on the project I have created visual identities, content strategies, information architecture, copyright, user experiences, user interfaces, style guidelines and logos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <h4 class="date-work">2010- 2014</h4>
      <p class="paragraph-wok">Freelance Designer.
        <br>Whilst at university I&nbsp;have worked on a number of small projects, both print and digital for different international clients.

      <p class="paragraph-white">The project was a 360 degree work that spanned across multiple media, context and digital environments. For them I defined brand identity, user experience, digital strategy, content creation, copyright and e-commerce. One year after the launch the shop is +700% sales.&nbsp;</p><a href="http://www.juliaexposito.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-ix="arrow-julia" class="w-clearfix w-inline-block link"><h1 class="w-hidden-tiny sub-heading-white">Julia Exposito Acupuncture</h1><h1 class="w-hidden-main w-hidden-medium w-hidden-small sub-heading-white">Julia Exposito</h1><img width="18" src="images/right-arrow.png" class="arrow-right-julia"></a>
      <p class="paragraph-white">As above the project involved all aspects of creating a digital presence for the brand.

        <br>
        <br>Formally educated as an&nbsp;interaction designer I now craft&nbsp;websites, create&nbsp;interactive installations,&nbsp;write&nbsp;and try to exercise daily with arguable results.&nbsp;

        <br>When I'm not dealing with pixels, motors, lasers or valves <a class="links-cv" target="_blank" href="http://captn-crop.com/product-category/caps/6-panels/">I&nbsp;craft handmade caps</a>.&nbsp;I make&nbsp;caps&nbsp;to get ready for the impending baldness and to personally support and contribute to craftsmanship in a time of mass-produced mediocrity.
        <br>Society deserves better products; better stories.
        <br>
        <br>I believe that happiness is to be found in the process of getting to something, not the actual thing. As such I am constantly submerged in multiple creative projects around the world. Sometimes for&nbsp;$, some other time for fun, <a class="links-cv" target="_blank" href="https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/topic/precious-plastic-help-us-make-new-logo/">virtue or ethic integrity</a>.

        <br>In September 2013 I stopped flying for environmental reasons. If that sort of thing floats your boat you can read about it&nbsp;<a class="links-cv" target="_blank" href="http://www.dailyinspiration.nl/one-year-without-flying/">here</a>.
