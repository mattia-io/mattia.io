<p><strong class="accent">Open Source Learning Platform</strong><br />
We developed <a href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="blank">Precious Plastic </a>as an opensource learning platform where people can learn how to build machines and techniques to recycle plastic. We have redesigned the website, established a digital strategy and crafted a campaign to maximize social reach upon launch. I was responsible for UX, UI, branding and strategy.</a></p>

<p><strong class="accent">The widest user spectrum ever</strong><br />
Precious Plastic audience is the most diverse we could possibly imagine. We individuated five user groups with totally opposite goals, needs, contexts, skills, internet speed and drives. Trying to accommodate such different user requirements was indeed the greatest design challenge for this project.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Precious Personas &amp; Goals</strong><br />
In the preliminary stage of the project we individuated five different Precious Personas to enact the distinct user requirement and goals outlined during the user research. This helped us focusing on essential features and cut out the superfluous. </p>

<p><strong class="accent">Rapid</strong><br />
The underlining imperative for the project was to create a light and fast website- to ensure a smooth experience in the west but most importantly to enable people with slow internet connections to access our services and knowledge. To achieve this we’ve discarded a number of superfluous features, limited our use of fancy Javascript and served different images based on screen size.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Ease of use</strong><br />
Ease of use was also a crucial point while developing the user experience and user interface. We iterated extensively on design strategy, content, information architecture, copy and visual hierarchies to make the user feel in total control at any given time. This was particularly important for the learning section.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Inclusive style</strong><br />
The project required a fine balance between a contemporary style and a more pragmatic, down to earth, DIY-ish approach. We didn’t want the website to feel too startup-esque, instead we wanted to convey a human feel to establish a safe environment for learning. We included work in progress images, raw illustrations, hand-drawn elements and video cuts that feels personal and human.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Campaign</strong><br />
To expand Precious Plastic’s social reach, both in developed and (most importantly) underdeveloped countries, we’ve created a launch campaign to increase our social reach. Inspired by online petitions, we’ve crafted a campaign page that provided people with a simple way of supporting the project by simply sharing or “spreading” as we’ve marketed it.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Critical Mass</strong><br />
Our launch campaign was very successful with an estimated social reach of over 100 mln people across continents and cultures within the first month. We believe this is the direct result of people anxieties about the plastic crises we’re living. People are now demanding for a change in society and the industry.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Precious Workflow </strong><br />
Meanwhile <a href="https://davehakkens.nl" target="blank">Dave Haskkens</a> was working on the machines &amp; videos, I started to define the UX and design the UI while developing an interactive, in-browser, high-fidelity prototype. User interface and user flows were constantly discussed, adjusted and iterated closely with Dave. As the prototype was ready we’ve prepared a detailed .sketch file for Leo, our developer, to translate into open source algorithmic beauty ready for launch.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Road Ahead</strong><br />
Given the project’s huge international success, we’re already working on version 3.0 to help the project scale and significantly boost plastic recycling. We currently working crowdsourcing the translation of the website, a new map to connect creators and new tutorials on how to use the machines and make products.</p>
