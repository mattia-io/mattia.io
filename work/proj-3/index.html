<p><strong class="accent">Power to the people</strong><br />
A human-centered logo for a distributed network of open-source machines that allows anyone to recycle plastic.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Be the change</strong><br />
Working on <a href="https://davehakkens.nl" target="blank">Precious Plastic</a> was a great opportunity be part of a meaningful project with a fantastic community and ambitious goals. Working closely with <a href="https://davehakkens.nl" target="blank">Dave Hakkens</a> and his community, we have redesigned Precious Plastic logo and redefined their branding.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Community Logo</strong><br />
For the new logo we have decided to open up the design process to <a href="https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/" target="blank">Dave Hakkens’ community</a>. People could directly influence design decision through a direct, digital design democracy. This process allowed us to truly understand our brand perception across diverse cultural backgrounds and semiotic perspectives.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Research</strong><br />
In the <a href="https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/topic/make-precious-plastic-logo-1/" target="blank">first exploratory stage</a> we’ve involved the community to gather some research &amp; inspiration as well as sketch out concepts &amp; ideas. We’ve had more than 130 entries in total that gave us a truly comprehensive interpretation of the essence of the brand Precious Plastic at a global scale.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Bit of order</strong><br />
After collecting all the entries, <a href="https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/topic/precious-plastic-help-us-make-new-logo/" target="blank">the second stage</a> saw us organizing and scrutinizing all the entries and selecting the ones we considered most relevant and suitable to be developed further. We’ve then asked the community <a href="https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/topic/vote-logo/" target="blank">to vote</a> five concepts to develop further. We’ve had a total of 225 votes.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Some facelifting</strong><br />
Out of the five logo concepts voted by the community, our team picked the three favorites and did all the necessary polishing &amp; facelifting. We then presented the community with the three finalist logos and asked for the final, decisive <a href="https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/topic/precious-plastic-final-logo-vote/" target="blank">voting</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">And the winner is…</strong><br />
In total 168 people voted and elected the new Precious Plastic logo in what can be considered a truly human-centered logo design.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Post apocalyptic </strong><br />
The new logo represents a revolutionary symbol from a post apocalyptic scenario. A mark for a community of people pragmatically coming to terms with the toxic legacy they are left to deal with. Using a plastic bag as a flag hints at the creative act of reverse engineering and poetic activism. The flag and plastic bag are used as simple, memorable and identifiable visual reference for cultures across the planet.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">One logo, hundreds of context </strong><br />
The nature of the project required a versatile logo that could be adapted to a number of diverse applications spanning across different mediums, context and cultures. It had to be visible and recognisable both on digital or analogue, small or large format, printed or lasercut, embossed or projected.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Globally local</strong><br />
To enable Precious Plastic to reach worldwide communities the team was faced with the design challenge to create a culture-agnostic logo that could be easily understood by a tech-savy fab lab guy in Germany as well as an Indian waste picker. To win this design challenge we’ve crafted a semiotically universal visual language that can adapt to radically diverse environments using two of the most common human artefacts: a flag and a plastic bag.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Style</strong><br />
To make sure a consistent visual style is maintained across all Dave Hankkens’ projects we’ve decided to create the logo with his personal and distinctive drawing style. This guarantees the necessary distinctiveness, visibility, adaptability, memorability, timelessness and universality- just as Paul Rand would have liked.</p>
