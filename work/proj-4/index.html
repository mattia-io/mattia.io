<p><strong class="accent">Expanding Global Creative Knowledge</strong><br />
<a href="http://whosaidthat.co/" target="blank">Who Said That</a> is the first quote website entirely dedicated to creativity, design and art. This is a personal project I have dreamt and developed throughout 2015.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Do It Yourself</strong><br />
I created Who Said That out of a personal necessity. I daily came across a huge number of beautiful concepts and quotes that I wanted to record and share. Googledocs, bookmarks or Evernote couldn’t meet my needs any longer, so I built a product for myself and others.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Creativity Database</strong><br />
Who Said That wants to become a valuable resource for a creative community in constant search of valuable inspiration for projects, keynotes, lectures or copywriting. Each quote features authors, tags, categories and links to the original source to enable quick referencing for academics &amp; professionals.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Make it yours</strong><br />
Each user can like quotes and create a personalized collection of all the quotes he/she ever liked for future reference. All quotes can also be sorted by Newest, Random or Favorite. Contextual categories makes it easy to filter quotes that are most relevant to the user. People can also submit their favorite quotes to expand creative horizons.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Ethereal Design</strong><br />
The website is a celebration of minimalism, typography, flat design and simplicity. The project has been an epic journey away from embellishment &amp; superfluous features in favour of simplicity and ease of use for a demanding audience. A subtle animation on quotes box gives an ethereal feel to the UX.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Minimal UI</strong><br />
The user interface is sober. It features the uttermost indispensable elements- quote, author, like button and more button. Its simplicity helps to focus on the quote’s concept, cutting through the noise.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Typomaniac</strong><br />
Typography is elegant and simple to celebrate clarity and establish a precise visual hierarchy. I used Brandon Grotesque Bold for main headers, sexy &amp; roundy Varela Round for the quotes text and the super versatile Source Sans Pro for authors and secondary information.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Great start</strong><br />
Shortly after launch, to my surprise and excitement the site was featured on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/who-said-that" target="blank">Product Hunt</a>’s homepage, <a href="http://sidebar.io/" target="blank">Sidebar.io</a> and a few other blogs. This helped kickstart the project and build a little following of like minded people. I am now diligently curating the website on a daily basis to provide high-quality content to the users.</p>
