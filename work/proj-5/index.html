<p><strong class="accent">Upcycling Revolution </strong><br />
I’ve recently become increasingly intrigued by upcycling as a philosophy and design strategy. <a href="http://www.anekdotboutique.com/" target="blank">Anekdot Boutique</a>, a startup from Berlin focusing on lingerie &amp; underwear, offered me the perfect opportunity to better understand and support the upcycling movement from within. I worked closely with the founder, Sofie Andersson, to establish her business from its embryonal stage through idea conception and business strategy all the way to the launch day and beyond.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Strategic Directions</strong><br />
The new venture had to focus and capture a growing market of like-minded people in search for alternatives to the current consumptive, alienating, homogenizing, stylistically sterilizing buying options. Tapping into a market that focuses on quality &amp; ethics without renounces, Anekdot Boutique wants to establish itself as a locally handcrafted venture to start the much needed cultural revolution.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Beautifully normal</strong><br />
Anekdot Boutique stands for a renewed understanding of fashion and beauty. Human beings are accepted and liked for what they are with all their natural imperfections. This is reflected in the brand’s tone, photoshoots and communication in clear opposition to mainstream understanding of beauty.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Name the name</strong><br />
Choosing the name was a mission in itself with thousands of ideas, iterations, tests and let go<span style="font-style: italic;">s</span>. Anekdot Boutique hints at a researched curiosity, unexpected surprise and personalized stories that connects to people, not consumers. Anekdot Boutique is about anecdotes, a pivotal creative force resisting mass produced mediocrity.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Logo</strong><br />
Endorsing the Scandinavian origins of Anekdot Boutique we crafted an elegant and sober logo that covey confidence and mindful innovation. Given a somehow novel and innovative business model that dives into uncharted fields of design and culture, to which society might be initially skeptic about, we had to be very cautious  with the visual language adopted.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Website </strong><br />
Whilst developing the website the main focus was simplicity, elegance, ease of use and an innovative visual language that could be smoothly enjoyed by both young digital natives and more mature women. We decided not to focus excessively on the product’s ethical aspect but rather its embedded stories and originality. The buying process is easy and straightforward being built on established design patterns to make the user feel in power at any given time. People can dive into the <a href="http://www.anekdotboutique.com/voyages/" target="blank">Voyage page</a> to discover latest collections and photoshoots.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Packaging </strong><br />
The packaging we created is simple and sober blending seamlessly with the rest of the branding and digital experience. We avoided too much earthy, eco feel and went for plastic when needed. However, we chose the most lightweight option to limit distribution fuel wastage.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">One year in</strong><br />
It is never easy to kickstart a new company. And it is even harder if the company is trying to challenge &amp; innovate accepted business model. However, we can safely say that the first year into business of Anekdot Boutique was a crescendo of success, sales, recognition, following and global interest. The power of design has hit again :)</p>
