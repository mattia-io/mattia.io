<p><strong class="accent">Vegan, fast food and fashion..sorry what again?</strong><br />
Fashion gurus David and Jakob from Dandy Diary, contacted me to help them manifest their latest stroke of creative genius, a vegan fast food in the heart of halal mecca Neukolln, Berlin. For the project I have created the logo, branding, packaging, strategy and website.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Paradoxically obvious</strong><br />
The concept for Dandy Diner’s identity is a celebration of the obvious- an happy pig.
A pig that is happy as a consequence of the vegan philosophy that likes to keep pigs alive. Rather simple, right?
While researching we were utterly amused by the macabre lie of mainstream logos featuring happy pigs for burger places or steakhouses. I am not vegan, but the paradox is crystal clear. We decided to challenge this visual convention in a creative and unequivocal way.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Flat pig</strong><br />
Upon nailing the concept, we started jamming with possible visual interpretations of the concept. We drew, sketched, traced &amp; painted a number of exploratory options. We soon realized we had to stylistically set ourselves aside from the conventional cartoon-esque approach. We opted for a flat style that feels modern and elegant.</p>

<p>The mark is the result of a radical simplification of strokes and colours. After many iterations we came up with a mark that is simple, cheerful, modern &amp; digital in line with Dandy Diner’s young and elegant audience. It’s simplicity and wit makes it memorable and incredibly versatile both for digital, print &amp; beyond.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Color scheme</strong><br />
We’ve crafted a color strategy that reflected the corporate feel wanted for the restaurant. We adopted a binary system that consist of full black and Rose Quartz (pantone of the year 2016). Upon agreeing on the color scheme we’ve applied it extensively across mediums- interiors, textiles, logo, packaging &amp; website.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Custom Typography</strong><br />
Whilst crafting the identity for the diner I felt it deserved something more than a standard type to stand out from the crowd. I then set out to craft a custom made logotype to be used both in digital, print and signage.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Simplicity = Confidence</strong><br />
The website had to digitally reflect the essence of the venue. We’ve maintained a flat approach, with a focus on extreme simplicity tailored for the diner’s fresh and curious audience. Simplicity to convey confidence. The website does not show any pictures hinting at the avant-garde nature of the project.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Elegantly fast food</strong><br />
The packaging represented a great design challenge having to merge fast food with elegance. It is in this context that the bold color scheme worked best for us. The meticulous combination of the two primary colours, different sizes and shapes helped conveying a sense of refinement and style.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">Public Response</strong><br />
After a blasting opening that saw the police having to close the venue for the excessive number of guests attending, people from all over the world come to the diner to enjoy a healthy bite and take the inevitable selfie with the pink vegan pig.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">360</strong><br />
For Dandy Diner I was responsible for the branding, packaging, signage, digital strategy, user experience, user interface and website. Needless to say I have learnt a great deal of skills along the way. Building on previous experience I have managed to handle a number of design challenges that made me a more informed designer.<br />
Happiness was hard to contain on launch night.</p>

<p><strong class="accent">*I went vegan</strong><br />
For the duration of the project I decided to embrace the philosophy and went on a fully vegan diet. This helped me to better comprehend the vegan idelogy and to freak out my poor italian granma.</p>
