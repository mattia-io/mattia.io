<p>Back in September 2014 I was approached by Dandy Diary’s
founders, David and Jakob, to design and develop
the mobile site for their blog (yes, that’s the time when people were still developing mobile versions..).</p>

<p>The blog is supposedly the biggest fashion blog in
german speaking countries with millions of visitors every month.
We combined an ultra-contemporary and smart aesthetic
supported by a strong and reliable functionality able to satisfy
their demanding followers and clients.</p>

<p>Full case study coming soon..</p>
