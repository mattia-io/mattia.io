					   					<p>Originally from Florence, trained in London, living in Berlin, working everywhere.<br><br>

										Formally educated as an interaction designer crafting websites, creating interactive installations and making stuff move, I now dedicate my entire life to boost plastic recycling worldwide. This project is currently taking priority over any other professional endeavour in my life given the urgency of the plastic pollution threat to life. <br><br>

										Right after university, I have spent a couple of years learning <a class="link-cv" href="http://captn-crop.com/" target="_blank">hat-making</a>. I decided to learn the craft to get ready for the impending baldness and to personally support and contribute to craftsmanship in a time of mass-produced mediocrity.
									<br>	Society deserves better products; better stories. <br><br>

										I believe that happiness is to be found in the process of getting to something, not the actual thing. As such I am constantly submerged in multiple creative projects around the world. Sometimes for $, some other time for fun, <a class="link-cv" href="https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/topic/precious-plastic-help-us-make-new-logo/" target="_blank">virtue or ethic integrity</a>. <br><br>


										In September 2013 I stopped flying for environmental reasons and manage to stay on the ground for 1003 days. If that sort of thing floats your boat you can read about it <a class="link-cv" href="http://www.dailyinspiration.nl/one-year-without-flying/" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br>

										*Sometimes I also use more than 3 colours in my designs. <br><br>
